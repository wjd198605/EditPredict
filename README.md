# EditPredict
EditPredict is a sequence-only, sequencing-independent tool, which is not purported to replace sequencing technology as the definitive method for detecting RNA editing events.
# How EditPredict works
GIREMI calculates the mutual information (MI) of the mismatch pairs identified in the RNA-seq reads to distinguish RNA editing sites and SNPs. It also trains a generalized linear model (GLM) to achieve enhanced predictive power, which makes use of sequence bias information and the difference between the mismatch ratio of the unknown single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and the estimated allelic ratio of the gene.
